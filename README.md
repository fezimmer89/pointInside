# NgPointInside

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Web Application Developer Coding Exercise

Build a simple web application that will do the following:

    1. Take user input for latitude and longitude
    2. Look up the timezone for the submitted coordinates using https://timezonedb.com/api
    3. Display the current local time for the submitted location

Build your app using any version of Angular that you are comfortable with, if it needs a server-side component, please use NodeJS.

Package up your source so that it can be easily built and run by our team. Deliver your solution via email as a link to GitHub, or a zip file in Dropbox or similar for our team to review.

## Running the project
    1. install nodejs - `nodejs v13.0.1` if you do not already have it
    2. install the application dependencies by running `npm install`
    3. run the server setup step using `ng run ngPointInside:server`
    4. and finally run the app 'npm start`

If you want to run any of the tests you will need to install the angular cli - `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
